Supplimental information for: "Estimating Herbarium Specimen Digitization Rates: Accounting for Human Experience"

__Note:__ The pre-cleaning task rate dataset (anonymized_task_data.csv) has been anonymized by replacing participant names with scientists' names present in the "Memory Alpha" database (https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Scientist). Replacement names were assigned randomly but uniformly applied such that individual's remain properly indexed throughout the dataset.
